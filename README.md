##Support Future Development

To support the future development of Sequence.js and other open source projects created by [Ian Lunn](https://github.com/IanLunn), please consider making a donation.

Your donation is not-for-profit (or beer!), and will allow Ian to spend a little less time on client projects and more time supporting and creating open source software.

Thank you.

**Bitcoin:**

Bitcoin donations may be sent to the following address:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<a href="bitcoin:1KEbFvcXL8m6LogG2wjSUFz2xH6PeN6jRd?label=Sequence%20Development"><img src="http://ianlunn.co.uk/images/btc-donate.jpg" /></a>

</div>

**Purchase a premium theme:**

If you'd like to support Sequence.js, please consider purchasing a [premium theme from SequenceJS.com](http://www.sequencejs.com/themes/category/premium/). Whether you need the theme or not, we thank you for your genoristy! We're open about our premium licenses so if you think a friend, colleague or client could make use of the theme instead, feel free to pass it on.

Why purchase a premium theme and not just make a donation? We'd like to give you something a little extra to say thanks! A payment of support is made through PayPal (don't worry, you don't need a PayPal account), so it keeps them and our accountants happy too -- because they're not keen on "donations".

If you'd rather not give up your hard-earned money but still want to show your support, we like to receive your feedback, ideas and opinions too.
